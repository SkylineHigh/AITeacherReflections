Alright, this system works so well now that the 25-minute trip to work this morning, at a relatively slow pace of talking or walking through some thoughts, produced just over 1000 words. Edited, it's like some decent prose that you can read through and acknowledge. What's funny is that the total word count on the unedited text was quite a bit more. In fact, I should compare them when I get home. I think this is an amazing advancement for productivity. This afternoon, I'm sure it will be the first official use of this process.

Today, I sent the paperwork to the State Office of Education for a session that will be offered at the Summer Conference. I will be taking the position of tackling the subject of AI in the classroom. Before I get too far into this, I also want to suggest that it feels like a dire warning, with incredible ramifications far different from what we experienced at the beginning of the last school year. We had no idea that this was even on the horizon. The gravity and importance of this topic seem dire to me, and yet it's remarkably quiet. It's almost disturbingly quiet, and I know my colleagues know about it. I'm very curious how many of them knew about it when I sent a warning email in December, just days after the public availability of Chat GPT. I did get a couple of responses from colleagues and a librarian, but nothing from the administration. Not one peep from the school administrators, who said absolutely nothing on the topic. They didn't chastise me for speaking out of line, nor did they give general comments about waiting to see what happens with this headline. And most importantly, there was no recognition or acknowledgement of the fiasco that was unfolding in education.

It only took days for the world to respond in many industries. Customer service shot to the top, and in our industry, the concern about coders and the non-technical people requesting code, not knowing what to do with it, were the top concerns in my opinion. These are the things that technology teachers concern ourselves with on a daily basis. It's a coupling or an amalgamation of two things that represent our entire world. I don't know if any of you have experienced this, but for once in my entire career, my subject matter, discipline, and area of concern, both in and out of school, were directly in focus.

Education and technology have always been fun because there's constant change. We don't teach the same concepts with the same software and tools. There are similarities, but it's always changing. However, this was not one of those changes. This was a relevant worldwide event that was proving to shape the minds and curiosity of people all over the planet. It shattered records of launch usage, and comparisons were made to Facebook and other mega social media platforms and different types of media services that took months or years to gain usership.

The championship that Chat GPT achieved in just a few days was monumental. It became a significant focal point in my personal life. Being an avid subscriber to numerous services, podcasts, and industry publications, I was quick to realize its emergence. Unfortunately, I hadn't personally experienced working with a large language model before. Although I had heard of them, I hadn't participated in anything that provided direct access to such a tool. I later discovered that I could have, and perhaps many of you were already aware of and utilizing these tools. However, in December, I made it clear to my colleagues that they couldn't ignore this. I promised them that by the end of the school year, it would impact and touch them, regardless of their teaching subjects.

From a more human perspective, the concern lies in the fact that teachers and individuals don't want to invest their heart and soul into integrating something only to find out later that it was a complete sham. Let's dwell on this for a moment because I have colleagues who demonstrate immense passion for their work. If a student were to deceive them by submitting a piece that appeared to be 100% original, and it deeply affected them—something profound enough to not only earn the student a good grade but also receive comments on the sudden improvement in grammar, articulation, and organization of thoughts—then it becomes an issue. These colleagues, who possess such passion, may be approaching retirement and are mentally unprepared for this new reality. They continue to trust that their students are genuinely writing their papers or, at the very least, if they're paying someone at a paper mill, it's still another human involved. However, the situation with Chat GPT is vastly different. It sparks new ideas, generates brainstorming lists, provides historical information, explores pop culture, and the possibilities are endless.

Interestingly enough, it's quite similar to us. It has learned exceptionally well. Just like us, it doesn't always adhere to the truth. In fact, sometimes we don't even attempt to tell the truth. We often try to push our own agendas. Mysteriously, this language model seems to have a problem with that. They refer to it as "hallucinations" in the field, and it's quite an unsettling term, if you ask me. The relevance of this issue is amplified.

I got fixated on the idea of this system becoming a paid service, and I immediately envisioned some practical concerns. Imagine students sitting in a classroom, glancing at their peers' screens or physical submissions, knowing that some had paid accounts and received significant assistance. Even if it's just the editorial functionality of the application, it raises questions. As for this talk and presentation today, my workflow for organizing my thoughts is as follows: when I come home from work, I change my shoes and shirt, grab the harness and leash, put on my headphones, and take my dog George out for a two to four-mile walk. During this walk, I use a voice recorder app that captures high-quality speech samples of my words. Before I even return home, I've already pressed around six buttons on my phone to send the recordings to a transcription service I pay $16 a month for. By the time I walk back through the door, I have a ready-to-download text file. On average, it takes me 20 minutes to edit 1000 words, so I work on sections rather than the entire transcript. For my record keeping, I pass chunks of the transcribed text through an AI system, asking a simple question: "Can you help me edit these thoughts?" I keep the original recording as a reference in case there are any doubts or if certain ideas require fundamental validation. Therefore, I have the untouched transcribed text, the edited version, and the original voice recording, all saved on my computer. In the past, the process I just described would take twice the amount of time. If it's a 40-minute walk with a 40-minute recording, it only accounts for listening and transcribing, assuming I don't get stuck on a thought or engage in extensive editing, expanding ideas, or altering concepts. That's the outcome—I don't just have transcripts. I am aware that transcription services have been available for a long time, but honestly, I believe there will soon be deals on them. Those in the industry know that their current model's days are numbered.

So, look them up—they're quite powerful. Within about five minutes of arriving home, I have an edited block of text that includes proper punctuation, paragraphs, and well-formed thoughts. Sometimes, it even produces bulleted or numbered lists and accurately depicts time. In fact, it can visualize almost anything I want. This technology is here to stay; something catastrophic would have to happen for it to disappear. Just this afternoon, Sam Altman has been addressing a special committee of legislators in our federal government. This is a significant topic, and I find it extremely perplexing that as we approach the end of the school year, there hasn't been an official declaration from our state, district, or local administration. In fact, I can't say any of that with certainty. Based on my experience, I would say that the local level, the school itself, has a better chance of shaping policy than anyone higher up the chain.

When I came across the proposal for presentations at this conference, I felt a curious motivation to once again convey the excitement and concerns surrounding this technological development. My goal is simple: I don't want to use this opportunity to impose policies, opinions, judgments, or certainties onto any educators or my peers. Instead, I want to unite our voices and initiate actions that prompt those higher up the chain to recognize the importance of this issue and the significant impact it can have. This is a pivotal milestone for technology, and there's a lot at stake for us in the realm of chat GPT, Bard, Bing, and other emerging systems. We must acknowledge what is and isn't acceptable.

I have provided a roadmap for the areas that need to be addressed, including a couple of wildcard factors. My vision for this conference is to ensure that everyone in attendance is mindful of the issue, and that we hear as many perspectives as possible. We need to acknowledge the spectrum of opinions in our world regarding the use of these technologies. On one extreme, there is total abstinence—I won't delve into the justification behind that, but there are valid arguments for advocating such a stance. On the other end of the spectrum, we have a total free-for-all, where every level of the education system, from teachers to administrators, district personnel, and state personnel, and perhaps even federal authorities, would embrace unrestricted use. It's easy to imagine the complexities that lie at either end. So, where do we stand in the middle, and what conditions or parameters might warrant the use of these technologies? That's the ultimate goal, and that's what drives me.

Alright, it's halfway through our walk, so this is part two of the introduction to the Summer Conference course on AI. First, I'd like to mention that during the session, I plan to record all thoughts and interactions. At the five-minute warning, I'll go through the process I'm describing with you, creating an edited dialogue of the entire session in the form of text, which will be made available today.

Let's face it, we're returning to a school year that will be vastly different from the last one. Being excited about technology just a year ago seems laughable compared to what we're about to face. We have so much to discuss and share, particularly in terms of the latest AI findings and the most significant trends in AI that directly impact education.

Now, I'd like to transition into an investigative activity. I'm presenting you with a challenge. You'll be given an article, heavily edited, and you'll have two minutes to prepare an elevator speech summarizing its main point. You need to read it, digest it, and identify the key message it conveys. Then, present it using the "six hats" method, which I will now explain. The six hats represent different perspectives or positions, and your task is to present your findings while wearing one of these hats, regardless of your actual position. Are we all clear on this? Are we ready to proceed?

Now, let's determine the number of samples we'll analyze. How about 12, 24, 36, or 48? It might be challenging to find that many samples, but they should address major positions on AI, such as large language models and other emerging trends in the field.

During the elevator speeches, we will conduct a gravity graph exercise to determine the positions that hold the most weight. Participants will voice their concerns, and you will have unlimited points to allocate to the topics that resonate with us as educators. We want to focus on a few key considerations for education, so make sure your points are specific to our day-to-day experiences. Feel free to explore broader concerns outside of this session and conduct your own research.

As concepts related to the elevator speeches are described, an assistant will record the number of "eyes" or agreements for each topic on the board. Keep in mind that these topics should be education-related and relevant to our decision-making process. Here are some questions to ponder: Are there regional factors that influence Utah's direction on the spectrum? What are students' current mindsets? When is the appropriate age to expose young learners to the full breadth of capabilities? Reflecting on my own experience, I can't imagine how this technology would have impacted me as a child.

Regarding app development, I have a timely idea that I'll mention briefly. Now, let's discuss protocols for handling abuse and define what constitutes abuse in an educational context. Should we include AI demonstrations, or do we risk limiting our scope and power as educators by admitting its use? I'd like to share the story of the Presidential Scholar to shed light on this topic. Additionally, let's consider the long-term effects of having instant access to answers on a device in our pockets. How far will humans go in integrating technology into our bodies?

As we explore these questions, we need to recognize that the capabilities of AI will surpass our current knowledge. We, as a species, might be slow to fully embrace the potential of a shared knowledge base that benefits everyone. Following the gravity map exercise, we will propose a charter that outlines our policies as Utah educators. Before engaging with the charter, take a moment to reflect and come up with your own plan. Remember, AI should be seen as a collaborator, not a replacement, which I believe is where we'll ultimately find a balance. Currently, we're in a phase of novelty, and it's worth considering a playful rendition of the Declaration of Independence rap by Homer Simpson to add some levity to the discussion. Let's proceed calmly and thoughtfully.
