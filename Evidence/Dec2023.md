Colleagues,

The quick version:  an AI bot has been open to the general public that is producing some incredible content. It has already been brought to my attention that papers can be generated very quickly with eerie specifics and believability. You can try to keep it under wraps, but the cat is definitely out of the bag.

Recommendation: create a policy about it and address it openly.

Now the long version:

On Sunday December 4th, officers from the Skyline TSA chapter were meeting remotely to plan, code, script, film and edit a video that was sent to me via email at 8:07PM. It was forwarded to Sky Cao who incorporated it into the weekly announcement video which was then uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday December 6th. A Google doc was created and saved on Sunday; this was used to collaboratively edit the script for the video. The video is saved under Sky Cao’s personal account. 

Meanwhile, conversations were underway during the entire school week about a new chatbot that became available to the general public about a week prior. Several students and I engaged in conversations comparing notes about our findings with this bot. I have logs saved that spotlight questions about astrophysics, coding, poetry, dog ownership, and the list goes on and on with an impressive degree of intelligence in the responses. I have taken time to segment some of the verbiage to see where on the web it might be gathering the information and while it is clear that popular sentiments are being articulated from existing content on the web, it is framing it in a way that will not repeat even the next time you ask the same question. 

OpenAI co-founded by Elon Musk opened their ChatGPT application “optimized for dialogue” and collects a user's telephone number and non-corporate, non-business email for “testing” purposes. It is likely that they are prioritizing what can be known about a user almost as much as they prioritize any inquiry. Finding that a user is a student at a high school would not be a leap. 

On Tuesday December 6th at 1:06PM, Nic Zhang, our TSA President went to the bot with a question. He was curious how the bot would tackle the task of preparing the highly specific script for our chapter video. He supplied the following inquiry:

“Write a script for an announcement video about a food drive that rewards donators with pixels to draw on a shared canvas”

I want to emphasize that there is NO mention of school, only the phrase “announcement video.” In the first line of a four-paragraph response the bot answers with, “We're excited to announce a new initiative at our school - a food drive with a twist.” The first line in the script for the video transcript and saved Google Doc script was, “Hey guys, we're from the Technology Student Association, and this month we're hosting a food drive, but with a twist.”

I'm not going to lie... that got my attention.
 
Now I don’t know what concerns me more, the likelihood that the bot had access to the transcript and/or the Google Doc or if it indeed came up with this on its own. The FAQ page states “ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.”

In any case, other inquiries have been made that will almost instantly craft well formatted verbiage of ANY kind… we are talking lesson plans, term papers, poetry, recipes, source code, essays, etc. I am in NO way suggesting anything like sentience or real human intelligence, but it is VERY sophisticated and thoughtful. Consider this: 

I asked, “If there were a void in the center of a planet, would it be without gravity?”

“No, a void in the center of a planet would not necessarily be without gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that is caused by the presence of mass or energy. The strength of gravity depends on the mass and distance of the objects involved, and it is not affected by the presence or absence of a void.

In the case of a planet with a void at its center, the gravity of the planet would still be determined by the total mass of the planet, including the mass of the material surrounding the void. The void itself would not have any mass or energy, and therefore it would not contribute to the planet's gravity.

However, the presence of a void in the center of a planet could affect the distribution of mass within the planet, which could in turn affect the planet's gravitational field. For example, if the void were large enough, it could cause the planet's surface to bulge or warp, which could change the shape of the planet's gravitational field.

Overall, while the presence of a void in the center of a planet could affect the distribution of mass within the planet, it would not necessarily cause the planet to be without gravity.”

We are entering a new realm with tech that is only going to get more elaborate over time. I am fearful of the reaction of humans/teachers learning that they have graded something produced by a bot. I believe it should be openly acknowledged and policies formed as a result.

Starting a repository of evidence for those that want to contribute can add to.

Thanks, sorry for the length...
