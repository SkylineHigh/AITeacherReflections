20 - Uncertainty about the future
The future of AI in education is uncertain. It is possible that AI will revolutionize education, but it is also possible that it will have a limited impact. It is important for schools to be prepared for both possibilities.

21 - Lack of research
There is limited research on the effectiveness of AI in education. This makes it difficult for schools to know which tools are worth investing in.

22 - Lack of standards
There are no agreed-upon standards for AI in education, which can make it difficult for schools to choose the right tools and implement them effectively.

23 - Student resistance
Some students may be resistant to using AI (or VR) in the classroom. This can be a challenge, as students need to be engaged in order to learn effectively.

24 - Teacher resistance
Some teachers are resistant to change, and they may be reluctant to adopt AI in the classroom. This can be a major challenge, as teachers are essential to the success of any AI-powered learning initiative.

25 - Access to AI Tools: Ensuring that educators have access to appropriate AI tools, platforms, and resources can be a challenge, particularly for schools with limited budgets or technological infrastructure.

26 - Training and Familiarity
Educators need to be trained and familiarized with AI technologies, including understanding their capabilities, limitations, and how to effectively integrate them into the teaching process.

27 - Photoshop Firefly
Photoshop subscribers can tap into the magic of Firefly, our family of creative generative AI models, directly in the Photoshop desktop (beta) app â€“ using their own, natural language to prompt Photoshop to create extraordinary images with Generative Fill. These prompts can be used to add content, remove or replace parts of an image and extend the edges of an image. Generative Fill is infused into every selection feature in Photoshop, and we have created a new generative layer type so you can work non-destructively. In addition, Generative Fill is also available as a module within the Firefly beta.

28 - AI Generated Web Portfolio
What if a student reports openly that they used an AI system to help generate technical content for a submission in your class?

29 - Copy Editing
Say exactly what you mean through clear, compelling and authentic writing. You create and AI makes it sound great!

30 - Digital Media Content
Students include charts/graphs and other media into presentations and other assignments. Where are the guardrails to a usage like this?
