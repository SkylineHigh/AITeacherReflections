Important points and things to consider when addressing the ChatGPT dilemma:

•	Alon’s Point: felt bad to see code that took a long time to write produced so quickly
•	Jasper’s Point: like a friend
•	When its not free: The person sitting next to you
•	Even if they strip things out, we know what it CAN do!
•	It WILL cause profound “coincidence” that will be hard for humans to deal with
•	Social divide from a moral and monetary standpoint
•	Inflation of student projects: college factor is profound
•	Its only going to get “better” – yikes…
•	If you go away to write something, nothing is guaranteed, and everything is suspect
•	If you can’t say it right here and right now… you don’t know it
•	How soon will you be beat out because someone used it… do you care?
•	On the spectrum of “don’t use under any conditions” to “use it for everything” where should we be.
•	Edicate: Don’t ever make someone evaluate any amount of what is produced with its aid unknowingly.
